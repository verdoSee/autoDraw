# Automatic mouse drawing with python.
<code> python -m pip install -r requirments.txt </code>

**Once you start the script you have 3 seconds to place your mouse cursor inside a canvas (preferably to left so it has space to draw the image).**<br />
**I would suggest you starting with a small dimension image, like the one i provided which is 300x300, and if you have more space you can go for bigger, it depends on the resolution of your screen**

**Attention!! If the drawing doesn't look right, you are probably using it in a slow canvas**
